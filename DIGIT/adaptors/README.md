DIGIT is designed to be natively compatible with the [Wonik's Allegro Hand](http://wiki.wonikrobotics.com/AllegroHandWiki/index.php/Allegro_Hand) 

In addition, we here provide files for 3d-printing adaptors for mounting DIGIT on several common robotic platforms:
- [Interbotix WidowX](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/widowxrobotarm)
- [Robotiq (2 and 3 fingers grippers)](https://robotiq.com/products)
- [Rethink Sawyer](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer/)
- [Shunk](https://schunk.com/us_en/gripping-systems/category/gripping-systems/schunk-grippers/)
- [Weiss WSG Series](https://weiss-robotics.com/wsg-series/product/wsg-series/)

We welcome adaptors contributed from the community.
