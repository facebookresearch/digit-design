Manufacturing design files for the [DIGIT tactile sensor](https://digit.ml).

**For updates and discussions please join the #DIGIT channel at the [www.touch-sensing.org](https://www.touch-sensing.org/) community.**

## Content

[This repository](DIGIT) contains the documentation and manufacturing files for the plastics enclosure, elastomer, electronics and the firmware binary.

## Design Notes

Due to some parts being out of stock due to shortages, we recommend the following part substituions:

* Digit Main PCB, Camera, OVM7692-RAAA with OVM7692-RYAA
* Digit Main PCB, MCU, FT900-R with FT900Q-C-T
* Digit Flex PCB, LEDs, ARGB1313HS-TR with 19-337C/RSBHGHC-A88/4T
    * Note: this change is only compatible with Digit Flex rev. 2021-2

## Quick Start

Manufacturing and assembly documentation is found in the [Quick Start Guide](/DIGIT/DIGIT_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf)

The manufacturing files are released in [releases](/DIGIT/releases) for PCBA fabrication.
