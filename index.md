### What is DIGIT?

DIGIT is an easy-to-build, reliable, low-cost, compact, high-resolution, tactile sensor designed for robotic in-hand manipulation.


<!--
### On what robots can DIGIT be mounted?

DIGIT is designed to be natively compatible with [Wonik's Allegro Hand](http://wiki.wonikrobotics.com/AllegroHandWiki/index.php/Allegro_Hand) 

In addition, we open source the mechanical files for 3d-printing adaptors for mounting DIGIT on several other robotic platforms:
- [Sawyer gripper]()
- []()
