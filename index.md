### What is DIGIT?

DIGIT is an easy-to-build, reliable, low-cost, compact, high-resolution, tactile sensor designed for robotic in-hand manipulation.



### On what robots can DIGIT be mounted?

DIGIT is designed to be natively compatible with the [Wonik's Allegro Hand](http://wiki.wonikrobotics.com/AllegroHandWiki/index.php/Allegro_Hand).
In addition, we [provide files](https://github.com/facebookresearch/digit-design/tree/master/adaptors) for 3d-printable adaptors for mounting DIGIT on several common robotic platforms.
